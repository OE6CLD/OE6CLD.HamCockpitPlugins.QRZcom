# OE6CLD.HamCockpitPlugins.QRZcom
QRZ Plugin for HamCockpit from Alex, VE3NEA

This started as a first project for HamCockpit. It will retrieve both information from QRZ.com (an account is needed) and qslinfo.de, which is much more up-to-date regarding QSL information than QRZ.com. If a picture is available on QRZ.com in the top right corner (usually the QSL card), it will show this as well.

This is work in progress and my first try with C# :)
